# Avatar the Last Airbender Trivia

## *Quiz your Knowledge*
#
**Project Description**

The application will create a game that quizzes the users' knowledge of the TV show Avatar the Last Airbender (ATLA). Fans of the show can use the quiz for fun or to compete with other fans since their scores will be logged in to a leaderboard.
The project is of interest to me becuase ATLA was my all-time favourite show growing up. Thus, I think it will be fun to integrate a childhood interest with a professional interest in a technical project.

## *User Stories*
- As a user, I want to choose my favourite character to play with
- As a user, I want to test my knowledge of the show *Avatar the Last Airbender* by selecting answers to questions
- As a user, I want to play the game until I win by answering all of the questions or lose all my lives
- As a user, I want to be able to add my score to the leaderboard and compare my score to my previous attempts along with other people's attempts
