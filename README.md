# Snake

## *A Game*
#
**Project Description**

The application will create a game that simulates a snake slithering around a board. The user controls the snake's movements and must prevent it from hitting the board boundaries and running into itself. The snake gets longer by eating apples that spawn on random locations on the board. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible.
